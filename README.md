# Annotator

The annotator will be a general solution leveraging [hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/) to annotate web pages and documents such as .doc and .pdf. The hypothesis web API provides nearly all required functionality.

# Added features

* Local annotation storage for manipulation with tooling such as [d2s](https://d2s.semanticscience.org/).
* General conversion to RDF based on project specific mapping files.
* Authenticated webhosting of PDF files not available publicly.

## Usecases

* Using annotated PDFs to pre-fill forms [Cross-border Company Mobility](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/cbcm).

## Repositories

* [annotator deployment](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/deploy-annotator)
* [annotator Hypothesis client](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/annotator-client)
